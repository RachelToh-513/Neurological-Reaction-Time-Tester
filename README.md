# Neurological Reaction Time Tester

## Course
SEEE3223 – C Language

## Project Description
This project measures a user’s neurological reaction time using an STM32 microcontroller.
A random delay is introduced before a visual signal is given.
Reaction time is measured using a timer and an external interrupt.
